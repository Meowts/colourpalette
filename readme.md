## ColourMixer!

Have fun mixing colours!

## How to use

Just clone or download this repos and open up colours.html in your favourite browser. That's it, no server required, just an AngularJS app that runs from your filesystem.

You can edit the base colours and the ratio they will be mixed at (x:y where x = row and y = column), and it will output each of the mixed colours and their respective RGB and Hex values.

**Note: this will not necessarily output a totally harmonious colour palette - you choose the base colours and mixing ratio based on your own knowledge of colour theory, and this will simply output the results. Intended for front end developers and digital artists :)
